# NewsAggregator

Stay informed, stay ahead: Your one-stop hub for the latest and greatest in current events.



What was the goal or intended purpose of our project? 
Our goal was to provide a start to a news aggregation website to compare sources of news and articles with varying subjects to provide an executive synopsis of current events. 
We hope that this web app development can lead to greater freedom and access to information. 

How does it contribute to any of the UN sustainability goals? 
Our web app will provide a means of accessing news sources, in this case from BBC, that contributes to learning about current events going on in the world and connecting the story to other events around the world.
